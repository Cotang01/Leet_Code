"""
Given a string s, return the number of unique palindromes of length three
that are a subsequence of s.

Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence,
it is still only counted once.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string
with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order
of the remaining characters.
